## SF Pro Display Assets

Place the official SF Pro Display font files from Apple in this directory with the following names so they match the `pubspec.yaml` configuration:

- `SFProDisplay-Regular.ttf`
- `SFProDisplay-Medium.ttf`
- `SFProDisplay-Bold.ttf`

After copying the files, run `flutter pub get` (or a hot restart) so Flutter can bundle them. The repository currently ships only with placeholders because the SF Pro license requires you to provide your own copy.***
